comp1202-coding-dojo-text-adventure
===================================

Text adventure that was live-coded by Pat, Rikki and Biscuits, with design 
advice from the audience, in the COMP1202 coding dojo, in two 1-hour sessions.

We have attempted this 3 times, in November of 2012, 2013 and 2014. The goal 
and approach have largely been the same each year, but there are a few 
variations in the precise design decisions the students took.
