kitchen	Your kitchen	The kitchen is in a frightful state. In the corner the sink is piled high with crockery in a pool of putrescent water. A number of items are strewn close at hand.
garden	The garden	The garden is largely unmaintained. Amongst the quivering blades of your meadow are strewn parts of your unfinished time machine.
university	The University of Southampton	As you approach the towering edifice of the Gower building looms over you. The campus is quiet today with only a few comatose undergraduates trudging between buildings in the chill of the wind.
